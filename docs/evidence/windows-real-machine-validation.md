# Windows Real-Machine Validation

Status: dated proof (2026-07-23).

Before this record the Windows adapter was covered only by research and unit
tests; Windows containers need a Windows host, so no end-to-end run had occurred
on a real machine. This is the first such run.

- **Scope:** the `fix/windows-watchdog-lifecycle` payload, installed and
  uninstalled through its own entry points on a live Windows host.
- **Verifier:** manual operation on the host plus `schtasks`, Win32 process
  ownership, token elevation (`GetTokenInformation`), and TCP listener queries.
- **Limit:** proves current install/lifecycle behavior on one host and build. It
  is not a claim about any historical Codex conversation, and it does not lower
  the authority of source, unit tests, `VERSION`, or CI.

## Host

- Windows 10 Enterprise, build 19045.
- Per-user CPython 3.14; `py -3` resolved the real interpreter and avoided the
  0-byte WindowsApps Store stub.
- Two contexts exercised: the interactive account, and a purpose-created
  standard user that is **not** a member of Administrators.

## Lifecycle fixes verified

Each fix in this branch was reproduced against its original real-host failure.

| Fix | Original real-host failure | Evidence after fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Watchdog self-heal | Killing the watchdog left it absent for 180 s (3× the interval); `RestartOnFailure` reacts only to a failed task *launch*, and a `LogonTrigger` `<Repetition>` only arms at an actual logon. | With the repeating `<TimeTrigger>` (past `StartBoundary` + `PT1M`) and `MultipleInstancesPolicy=IgnoreNew`, a killed watchdog relaunched in ~32 s; repeated fires while alive were no-ops. |
| Uninstall stops the watchdog | `schtasks /delete` removed only the definition; the surviving watchdog respawned the proxy in the same second. | Uninstall now terminates the watchdog matched to this install's own launcher/script paths; after uninstall the watchdog and proxy were gone and nothing respawned over a full interval. |
| Windowless run | The `cmd.exe /c` wrapper held a visible console for the whole watchdog lifetime. | The task runs a generated `.pyw` via `pythonw.exe`; the watchdog and proxy report `MainWindowHandle=0` and no `cmd`/`conhost` is allocated for them. |

## Standard-user interactive logon

Two properties can only be observed under a real interactive logon of a standard
user; they were confirmed here from a separate elevated session after a
fast-user-switch logon of the standard account.

| Property | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| (a) Auto-start at logon under the standard user | On logon the watchdog `pythonw` appeared owned by the standard user, and the proxy was spawned as its direct child, also owned by the standard user. |
| (b) Non-elevated least-privilege token | Both the watchdog and proxy reported `TokenIsElevated=0` with `ElevationType=1` (Default; no split token). |
| Route rewrite | The standard user's `config.toml` `base_url` pointed at the loopback listener. |
| Listener | The proxy owned the loopback listener on the configured port. |
| Idempotent self-heal | While the watchdog was alive, the task's last result was the `IgnoreNew` duplicate-instance rejection (`0x800710E0`), i.e. a re-fire is a no-op. |

### Note on elevation type

`ElevationType=1` here means an ordinary standard-user token with no UAC split,
which is the intended result for `InteractiveToken` + `LeastPrivilege`. The
built-in Administrator account instead reports `TokenIsElevated=1` because that
account has no filtered token to hand back; that is a property of the account,
not a defect in the task principal. The standard-user run is the authoritative
check for non-elevated operation.

## Residual limit

The offline unit suite passes except for two POSIX `chmod 0o600` assertions that
Windows cannot satisfy (the mode reads back `0o666`). That is a test-platform
limitation, not a payload defect.
