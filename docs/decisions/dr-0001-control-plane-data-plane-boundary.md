# DR-0001: Keep Control Plane Separate from Proxy Data Plane

- Status: amended
- Date: 2026-07-14

## Context

A client control plane projects provider configuration. The proxy provides
local Responses compatibility and a loopback service. Letting both write the
same configuration or manage each other's lifecycle causes drift, unsafe
recovery, and ambiguous rollback responsibility.

## Decision

The client control plane owns provider blocks, credentials, endpoint selection,
and configuration projection. Codex Responses Proxy owns outbound protocol
normalization, its executable payload, and its native service lifecycle. The
installed proxy is generated from source and verified with a manifest. It never
writes client configuration or invokes a particular control-plane product.

## Consequences

The products evolve independently and each mutation has one owner. Runtime
repair rebuilds the proxy projection; route repair remains a client control-plane
operation. Neither path permits session-history mutation.

## Revisit Trigger

Revisit only if the proxy becomes an explicit client configuration control
plane or a client control plane adopts proxy transport and native service
lifecycle ownership.
