# DR-0002: Keep Responses Replay Stateless and Provider-Portable

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-07
- Last amended: 2026-09-23

## Context

Third-party Responses providers do not share stored conversations, response or
item identifiers, encrypted reasoning state, or replay extensions. Reusing one
provider's continuation state after a route switch causes invalid requests and
can bind a client conversation to one upstream.

## Decision

Every outbound Responses request sets `store=false` and is rebuilt from one
closed provider-portable grammar. The projection removes provider-issued
response, conversation, cache, stored-item, search and replayed-reasoning
bindings while retaining portable dialogue and complete tool relationships.
Required encrypted agent messages are native control data, not removable
provider history: preserve their original envelope and ciphertext for the
selected upstream. An upstream rejection cannot prove that the visible routing
header contains the task, so it is relayed without a ciphertext-free retry.
Unknown or structurally unproved replay material fails locally.

Recovery consumes only the already-projected representation or a strictly
smaller derivation of it. No recovery path restores an earlier provider-bound
request, reads client conversation storage, or claims to decrypt ciphertext.
Requests carrying encrypted agent messages cannot use shrinking recovery.

## Consequences

A portable conversation can switch among admitted providers without server-side state.
Continuity depends on client-replayed portable dialogue rather than a provider
store. The proxy may reject an input that lacks a proved portable meaning
instead of guessing or silently dropping a required tool relationship.
Encrypted delegation requires an upstream able to interpret its native control
payload; cross-provider decryption is not guaranteed. A visible message envelope
is not proof that its task body survived transport.

This also preserves route mobility: switching Provider Accounts does not depend
on another provider's stored response or opaque item identifier. This mobility
claim excludes encrypted native delegation. Provider-specific recovery consumes
the same portable owner or a strictly smaller derivation; it cannot become a
parallel replay implementation.

## Revisit Trigger

Revisit when native control-message semantics change, or when the ecosystem
provides a documented interoperable encrypted transport. Require a real
sender-to-recipient content witness, not merely accepted JSON or a healthy listener.
