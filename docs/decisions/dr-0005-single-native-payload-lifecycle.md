# DR-0005: Maintain One Native Payload and Lifecycle Model

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-07

## Context

Parallel source, wheel, interpreter, compatibility-switch, and native payload
models create ambiguous ownership and unsafe rollback. Keeping readers or
migrations for retired layouts makes every lifecycle operation carry historical
states that the current product no longer needs.

## Decision

The installed product has one manifest-owned native bundle, one native
user-command link, and one native supervision lifecycle. The bundle exposes one
executable and carries its frozen runtime dependencies as adjacent
manifest-owned files. Installation accepts an empty target or one verified
current listener. The transaction commits the verified projection, prewarms
that exact executable before handoff, projects it through a platform-native
link, and records that exact path in the existing installed-state record. An
incompatible installation or foreign command target fails before mutation and
must be removed explicitly.

Rollback and recovery use exact manifests, receipts, command-link ownership,
runtime identities, and one selector under the stable control root. The
selector alone names the active immutable generation and its optional sole
predecessor; installed state and the command projection stay outside both.
The active generation owns serving and native supervision, while the command
resolves to the newer verified selected release. Explicit serving rollback
therefore cannot downgrade lifecycle control or reopen replay admission.
Finalization atomically advances that selector, retires superseded generations,
and proves the closed terminal state. The active transaction remains the
recovery authority throughout every intermediate state. Its payload snapshot
is temporary bootstrap or recovery evidence, never a second retained store.
The first release that introduces immutable generations is a bounded bootstrap
exception: its verified executable drives that one upgrade because the older
installed executable cannot own semantics it never shipped. Source-level
compatibility shims, forwarding facades, wrappers, shell-profile mutation,
retired layout readers, and automatic migration from unsupported payloads are
not product surfaces.

## Consequences

Lifecycle behavior has one owner and a smaller state space. A breaking payload
change may require explicit uninstall and reinstall rather than an implicit
migration. Historical release evidence remains immutable but does not constrain
the current runtime model.

## Revisit Trigger

Revisit only when a supported in-place migration is a current product
requirement with explicit ownership, failure semantics, and end-to-end proof.
