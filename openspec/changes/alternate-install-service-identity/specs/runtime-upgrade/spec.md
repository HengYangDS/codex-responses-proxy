## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Native supervision is self-contained and portable

The released executable SHALL install and inspect its user service through the
native macOS, Linux, or Windows adapter without an ambient Python interpreter,
optional process utility, source path, user identity, or workstation-specific
coordinate. The default installation SHALL retain the public service identity;
every alternate installation root SHALL use a deterministic identity derived
from that root. Signal paths SHALL revalidate exact process identity
immediately before mutation.

#### Scenario: A supported host lacks development tools

- **WHEN** the product is installed on a clean supported host
- **THEN** service installation, listener discovery, handoff, status, and
  uninstall remain available from the released executable alone.

#### Scenario: An alternate root is installed for validation

- **WHEN** a signed asset is installed with a non-default product data root
- **THEN** native supervision SHALL use an identity unique to that absolute root
- **AND** installation SHALL not unload, replace, or report the default service
- **AND** uninstall SHALL address only the alternate identity and its listener.

#### Scenario: The default root is upgraded

- **WHEN** the signed installer targets the canonical product data root
- **THEN** it SHALL use the public service identity and current handoff protocol
- **AND** alternate validation identities SHALL remain untouched.
