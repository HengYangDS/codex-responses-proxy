## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Terminal candidate integration is exact and local

A proven work lane SHALL advance the local candidate only through an explicit
compare-and-swap authority bound to the complete accumulated lane delta.

#### Scenario: The candidate remains the observed ancestor

- **WHEN** full proof passes for the clean archived work-lane HEAD
- **THEN** ETHOS SHALL move `candidate/dev` only from the previously observed ref
- **AND** any candidate, Lease, tree, or proof drift SHALL fail closed
- **AND** no remote Forge SHALL be queried or mutated.
