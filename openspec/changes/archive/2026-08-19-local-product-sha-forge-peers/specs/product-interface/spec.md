## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Local product closure is Forge-free

The repository SHALL keep local Git as the sole product source and SHALL make
GitLab and GitHub optional, independent publication peers. A selected Forge
SHALL receive the exact signed local commit object without changing author,
committer, parents, tree, message, or signature. `main` publication SHALL
atomically advance remote `main` and `dev`; `proposal/*` SHALL publish only the
selected proposal. `candidate/dev` and `work/*` SHALL remain local-only.

#### Scenario: Both Forges are unavailable

- **WHEN** a clean accepted checkout has no reachable remote
- **THEN** local verification, packaging, installation, runtime acceptance,
  update, rollback, and uninstall remain executable
- **AND** no hosted publication fact is claimed.

#### Scenario: Either Forge is independently available

- **WHEN** GitLab or GitHub alone is selected for publication
- **THEN** it receives the exact local signed commit OID and tree
- **AND** the unavailable peer is neither read nor required.

#### Scenario: Both Forges are independently available

- **WHEN** each peer is selected in a separate publication operation
- **THEN** local, GitLab, and GitHub branch tips are the same commit OID
- **AND** each Forge retains independent authentication, CI, Release, and asset state.

#### Scenario: Source proof is complete

- **WHEN** exact-HEAD repository proof passes and the Change is archived
- **THEN** the governed landing command can atomically advance `candidate/dev`
- **AND** the permission does not authorize direct publication or runtime mutation
- **AND** no alternate integration path is introduced.
