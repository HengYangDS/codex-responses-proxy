## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Upgrade converges the native supervisor generation

After candidate payload commitment and before listener handoff, installation
SHALL replace the platform-native supervisor with one running watchdog
generation executing the canonical committed payload. Product runtime identity
SHALL be reconstructed from the committed, secret-free `runtime-config.json`;
operating-system service definitions SHALL remain derived projections and SHALL
NOT duplicate product configuration. A watchdog that starts a listener SHALL
retain and poll its process handle so an exited child is reaped. If subsequent
handoff rolls back, installation SHALL restore the predecessor payload and
replace native supervision from that payload before returning failure.

On macOS, installation SHALL bind the exact GUI-domain service, prove any
predecessor watchdog PID has exited, bootstrap the current plist, and re-read
the exact successor PID. Plist registration, executable-path equality, or a
successful platform command alone SHALL NOT establish convergence.

#### Scenario: One runtime carrier projects to native service managers

- **WHEN** a committed payload is installed on macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **THEN** the watchdog and native-service adapter reconstruct the same exact
  executable, installation root, log root, and service identity from
  `runtime-config.json`
- **AND** launchd, systemd user services, or Task Scheduler contain only the
  native invocation and service-manager metadata
- **AND** no platform definition becomes a second product configuration source.

#### Scenario: An installed macOS watchdog is replaced during upgrade

- **WHEN** candidate payload bytes have committed while an earlier watchdog
  generation is registered
- **THEN** the installer boots out the exact prior launchd service
- **AND** proves the predecessor PID is absent within a bounded deadline
- **AND** bootstraps the current plist into the exact GUI domain
- **AND** accepts only a distinct running PID returned and re-observed for the
  exact service label
- **AND** leaves the independent listener serving throughout replacement.

#### Scenario: A current native runtime is upgraded

- **WHEN** candidate bytes have committed and the current listener remains
  accepting
- **THEN** the native supervisor is replaced by a generation executing the
  candidate payload
- **AND** listener handoff begins only after the exact service registration,
  executable, and running generation are proved.

#### Scenario: A watchdog-owned listener exits

- **WHEN** a listener spawned by the resident watchdog reaches a terminal
  process state
- **THEN** the watchdog polls its retained process handle
- **AND** no zombie process remains owned by that watchdog.

#### Scenario: Handoff rolls back after supervisor replacement

- **WHEN** successor handoff fails with a proved rollback outcome
- **THEN** the predecessor payload is restored
- **AND** native supervision is replaced by a generation executing that restored
  payload.

#### Scenario: Launchd cannot prove generation replacement

- **WHEN** bootout, predecessor exit, bootstrap, kickstart, or successor PID
  observation fails or is ambiguous
- **THEN** installation fails with an actionable lifecycle error
- **AND** does not report native supervision as converged.

#### Scenario: An isolated native lifecycle ends

- **WHEN** a noncanonical installation succeeds, fails, times out, or raises
- **THEN** teardown removes the exact service registration and projection path
  used at creation
- **AND** proves every process owned by that exact service has exited
- **AND** leaves the canonical service and listener unchanged
- **AND** the set of noncanonical host service projections has no net growth.
