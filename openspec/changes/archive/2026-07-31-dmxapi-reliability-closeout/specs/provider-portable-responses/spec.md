## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Paired empty tool results remain explicit

A correctly paired function or custom-tool result whose exact output is the
empty string SHALL retain its call kind and `call_id` and SHALL use one stable
plaintext empty-result marker in the outbound request copy. The exception SHALL
NOT apply to ordinary dialogue, missing or null output, or an invalid pair.

#### Scenario: A paired tool result is textually empty

- **WHEN** a valid function or custom-tool output follows its matching call and
  its exact result is the empty string
- **THEN** the outbound request retains the pair with the fixed empty-result
  marker
- **AND** it is not rejected as an empty dialogue message.

#### Scenario: Empty ordinary dialogue remains invalid

- **WHEN** a system, developer, user, assistant, or synthesized dialogue message
  contains no portable text
- **THEN** the proxy rejects the shape locally
- **AND** the empty-tool-result exception does not apply.
